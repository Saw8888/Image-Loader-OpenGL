The file has to be in .ppm format and when converting you have to put all the values inside an array inside the .ppm file, an image can be turned into a .ppm using gimp, it is important to set the format to ASCII NOT RAW and to delete the first 5 lines of the file in a text editor, for a prime example check the wall.ppm file in main.
